# Los Pueblos Magicos De Mexico (The Magical Towns of Mexico) (work in progress)

Ever visited Mexico or thought about visiting? If you are like a lot of people (including younger me) when you think of Mexico, Cancun may come to mind or Tijuana. Mexico has a rich and colorful history. The Pueblos Magicos are Magical town located all over Mexico. I've created an API that will show you the true beauty of Mexico!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express, MongoDB


## Optimizations

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:
