      Ever visited Mexico or thought about visiting? If you are like a lot of
      people (including my younger self), when you think of Mexico, Cancun or
      Tijuana may come to mind. Mexico has a rich and colorful history with
      various climates and terrains. The Pueblos Magicos are Magical towns
      located all over Mexico. I've created an API that will show you the true
      beauty of Mexico and hopefully encourage you to visit one (or many) of
      these Pueblos! I hope you enjoy and happy exploring!

      While the website does have nearby airports to the Pueblos. I want you to
      explore the towns and do further research if you are planning on visiting.
      There are various routes to getting to these Pueblos depending on where
      you are coming from. Let your curiosity guide you. - Jaime
